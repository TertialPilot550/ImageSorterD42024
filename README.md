# ImageSorterD42024
Small Java program to help sort graphs :)

Instructions:
- place the '/png' folder containing the graph images you want to sort into the project directory (not         /src)
- make sure the folder is still named '/png'. I recommend placing only your portion of the images into the folder (but it'll work either way as long as the images have consecutiev ID's).
- replace the START_INDEX variable in the ImageSorter.java file with the first Image ID you would like to open
- run the program.
  
The program will make three subfolders within the /png folder. It is important that the base folder is named /png.

- A key press of 1 will move the image into the /png/goodImages subfolder.
- A key press of 2 will move the image into the /png/badImages subfolder.
- A key press of 3 will move the image into the /png/otherImages subfolder, for later review.
- A key press of q, or closing the window, will quit the program.
